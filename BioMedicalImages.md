# Bio Medical Images

Lets understand how the images are capture in the camera.
In last article we discuss, camera has a light sensors array which stores the lights as an electrical signal. 
In different imaging technics source of light is different and how it reaches to light sensors is varies. 
General digital camera?


What is bio medical images?

Different types of bio medical images?
    xray, electron images, fluorescence images

General Difference between electron/xray and fluorescence images. 

Focus of fluorescence images.
    why? because of phd research.
    details on how fluorescence images are capture, example microscope diagram.
    details on fluorescence:
        light emition.
        Excitation/Emission Spectra, Stokes Shift, Jablonski Diagram, Fluorophore, Dichroic / Filter.
